        RetroWar Anti-Cheat
      </h2>
      <p>
        A basic, yet functional Anti-Cheat system for a private game server, sadly it was never finished due to the game being canceled.
        <br>
        This project is what pushed me to make an Anti-Cheat system as my bacherlor's degree final project.
